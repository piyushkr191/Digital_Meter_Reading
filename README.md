Introduction
The primary goal of this project is to develop an end-to-end application for automated electric meter reading. Leveraging advanced object detection and traditional image processing techniques, this system is designed to minimize costs and labor requirements by automating the reading process.

Primary Objective
The main objective is to create a robust application for detecting and reading electric meter values automatically. The application utilizes the YOLOv8 model for object detection and various traditional image processing techniques for numeric extraction.

Specific Objectives
Object Detection with YOLOv8
Develop and implement a custom-trained YOLOv8 object detection model.
Detect the electric meter in the uploaded image by forming a contour around it.
Numeric Extraction with Traditional Image Processing
Utilize traditional image processing techniques to extract numeric data from the detected electric meter.
Process the uploaded image through methods such as resizing, color conversion, blurring, edge detection, and contour approximation to accurately identify and extract the numeric information displayed on the meter.
Technologies Used
YOLOv8 Model for Meter Detection: Used for accurately identifying electric meters in real-time.
Traditional Image Processing Techniques: Applied for preprocessing, postprocessing, and numeric extraction tasks.
Django Framework: Used to develop the web application, handling user interactions, image uploads, and backend processing.
Dataset
Acquisition
The dataset comprises 900 raw images of electric meters, provided by the project mentor. These images were initially non-annotated.

Labelling
The images were annotated using the Roboflow platform, marking the electric meters to create a labeled dataset for training the YOLOv8 model.

Methodology
Django Web Application Implementation
The application was developed using Django, a high-level Python web framework known for its simplicity and robustness.

Meter Detection
Model Training: The YOLOv8 model was trained on the annotated dataset to detect electric meters accurately.
Detection Process: The trained model was used to detect meters in user-uploaded images, drawing contours around detected meters.
Image Analysis
Preprocessing: Includes resizing, cropping, rotation, color conversion, and blurring to prepare the images for further analysis.
Postprocessing: Techniques such as contour approximation, bounding box creation, and morphological transformations are used to refine detected regions.
Numeric Extraction: Involves extracting numeric data from the meter's seven-segment display using edge detection and contour analysis.
Results
Project Outcomes
The custom-trained YOLOv8 model achieved high accuracy in detecting electric meters in user-uploaded images. The traditional image processing techniques for numeric extraction further enhanced system reliability.

Comparison with Objectives
The project met its primary and specific objectives, providing a robust and scalable solution with improved accuracy and efficiency compared to manual methods.

Conclusion
The project successfully developed an end-to-end application for automated electric meter reading. By leveraging YOLOv8 and traditional image processing techniques, the system provided an efficient, accurate, and scalable solution for meter reading. This success lays the groundwork for future enhancements and potential integration with advanced machine learning models.
